Contextmenu support for Mapael

Hi Vincent Brouté

My name is Tien from Viet Nam, a web engineer just like you .
I’m looking for geomap drawer for my app and this example from your website matches exactly what I need, awesome!
Only one thing missing that I need to add context menu to each plot but there is no option for that in your Mapael. 
I found an example from jsfiddle here but it uses Raphael.
I wonder if you can take a look into that example and guide me how to do the same thing with your Mapael, I really appreciate that!

Thanks and Best Regards,
Tien
